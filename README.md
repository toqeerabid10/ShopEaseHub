ShopEaseHub

Welcome to ShopEaseHub! This is an e-commerce application built with the MERN stack.
This project is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which helps in organizing the code by separating the application into three interconnected components:

the Model for data management, the View for the user interface, and the Controller for handling user interactions and application logic.
